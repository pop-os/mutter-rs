    /// effect is free to assume that the actor has not changed its
    /// appearance since the last time it was painted so it doesn't need to
    /// call `clutter_actor_continue_paint()` if it can draw a cached
    /// image. This is mostly intended for effects that are using a
    /// `CoglOffscreen` to redirect the actor (such as
    /// `ClutterOffscreenEffect`). In that case the effect can save a bit of
    /// rendering time by painting the cached texture without causing the
    /// entire actor to be painted.
    ///
    /// This function can be used by effects that have their own animatable
    /// parameters. For example, an effect which adds a varying degree of a
    /// red tint to an actor by redirecting it through a CoglOffscreen
    /// might have a property to specify the level of tint. When this value
    /// changes, the underlying actor doesn't need to be redrawn so the
    /// effect can call [`queue_repaint()`][Self::queue_repaint()] to make sure the
    /// effect is repainted.
    ///
    /// Note however that modifying the position of the parent of an actor
    /// may change the appearance of the actor because its transformation
    /// matrix would change. In this case a redraw wouldn't be queued on
    /// the actor itself so the `CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY` would still
    /// not be set. The effect can detect this case by keeping track of the
    /// last modelview matrix that was used to render the actor and
    /// verifying that it remains the same in the next paint.
    ///
    /// Any other effects that are layered on top of the passed in effect
    /// will still be passed the `CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY` flag. If
    /// anything queues a redraw on the actor without specifying an effect
    /// or with an effect that is lower in the chain of effects than this
    /// one then that will override this call. In that case this effect
    /// will instead be called with the `CLUTTER_EFFECT_PAINT_ACTOR_DIRTY`
    /// flag set.
